# IRF510-rf-amplifier

This amplifier was designed as a pspice simulation project. Later I have build and tested it.
The goal was to see if sources of distortion could be found and how certain components infuence the linearity of the amplifier.
In the simulation schematic extra components are added to simulate loss in the transformers. Changing these loss components give rise to more or less distrortion
